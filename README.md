Aims
The project aims to automate the creation of web galleries for those people who don't want to/can't install a separate gallery or store their images in a database.

The project has recently undergone a rewrite. The script is now written in Perl to make it more portable.

Features
The project has a number of features such as:
- Specifying a customised thumbnail and main image size
- lightbox2 support (both individual and group)
- "Standalone" and "included" formats to either stand on it's own or slot into an existing template. The standalone feature has a choice of making HTML4 (strict), XHTML1.0 (transitional), and XHTML1.1.
- All of the HTML outputted by the current script is valid markup.
