The script is now written in Perl to make it more portable.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nThe project has a number of features such as:\r\n- Specifying a customised thumbnail and main image size\r\n- lightbox2 support (both individual and group)\r\n- \"Standalone\" and \"included\" formats to either stand on it's own or slot into an existing template. The standalone feature has a choice of making HTML4 (strict), XHTML1.0 (transitional), and XHTML1.1.\r\n- All of the HTML outputted by the current script is valid markup.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
